# About Me
-------
I'm a recent graduate from the Momentum Learning coding bootcamp. 
This website is an exercise in applying and showcasing what I've learned while also testing some new waters.

I'll be checking out gatsby, diving back into react, and using css in js methodology with styled-components.
